I am deeply interested in art and regularly collaborate with professionals across fields to create projects and events that bring science and art together.

#### Breaking boundaries (2023-2024) 
------

**[Breaking boundaries](https://breakingboundaries.myportfolio.com/)** was part of the exhibition NDSM Fuse Xpo XIV: Op de Vlucht (On The Run); 1 September 2023 - 10 March 2024 NDSM-Plein 29, Amsterdam (NL) [NDSMFuse.eu](https://www.ndsm-fuse.eu/)


Border walls symbolize a world where refugees are unwelcome. As people seek safety in a new land, they often encounter barbed wire and severe hostility, reflecting the adverse attitudes towards them across the globe. 
Inspired by the interactive murals at the Tijuana-San Diego border wall, Breaking Boundaries presents a stark contrast between both sides of a border wall. On one side lies the homeland, where memories coexist with the violence of escaping. On the other side stands the new land offering safety, yet shadowed by discrimination.  Breaking Boundaries seeks to evoke the experience of a new beginning, where unity and empathy transcends the barriers of the border-walled world today.

Project developed in collabroation with visual artist and art educator [Marcela Perrusquía](https://marcelaperrusquia.com/blogs/news/about) and photographer and project manager Arts & Culture, City of Amsterdam [Benny van der Plank](https://bennyvanderplank.com/about-1).

#### Life from a different perspective (2023) 
------

The installation **[Life from a different perspective](https://osf.io/b9d6t/files/4uhkv)** was selected to be part of the ['Hear all Voices' exhibition](https://www.treehousendsm.com/agenda/hear-all-voices) that took place at Treehouse, NDSM, June and July 2023, supported by AFK (Amsterdams Fonds voor de Kunst).

This art and science project reflects on how people in a multicultural society have different needs. It focuses on a flexible and inclusive approach to meet these needs and challenges
the one-size-fits-all idea. Particularly, it highlights the importance of recognizing and valuing singularities within communities. It encourages people to consider their own needs, while
promoting empathy for others’ needs, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility. The project seeks to generate a deeper insight about the space and relevance of different voices
in our society, and of ways of creating an inclusive environment where these voices can be heard and coexist.

Using a multi-method approach and mixed-media art techniques, we prototyped alternative governance systems. The concept draws on an analogy where different types of seeds - each
with distinct needs - represent diverse people and their voices. Greenhouses symbolize societies in which governance occurs, while water represents the resources available to
address these needs. Viewers were invited to decide which greenhouse should receive the available water.
