## About 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Connected Minds Lab](https://connectedmindslab.net/) in the [Department of Developmental Psychology at the University of Amsterdam](https://psyres.uva.nl/content/research-groups/programme-group-developmental-psychology/programme-group-developmental-psychology.html).

My research investigates young people’s social media use and its links to mood and mental health. I also examine how online experiences shape identity development and the opportunities and challenges faced by minority groups. In addition to a developmental perspective, I am involved in a [ManyLabs collaboration](https://globalsocialmediastudy.com/), where I lead the Netherlands team to study how these dynamics vary across cultural contexts worldwide.

Methodologically, I combine computational modeling (e.g., reinforcement learning and large language models), machine learning approaches (e.g., random forests and NLP), social network analysis, and experimental designs. Across projects, I integrate longitudinal, real-world behavioral data (e.g., social media trace data), text data and self-report measures.

I earned my PhD in Psychology at the University of Amsterdam, where I studied social learning strategies during adolescence in the context of school-based social networks and social media, with a focus on social norms and feedback. Broadly, my work shows that the influence of social information on belief and intention formation depends on the source, whether it comes from [peers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92482-8) or [teachers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jora.70063?af=R), and that these effects change across [development](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/11/1/150354/214997/Pathways-From-Norms-to-Intentions-A-Developmental). As social learning increasingly takes place online, my research on [social media feedback](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp8775) indicates that adolescents are more sensitive to online feedback than adults, and that their mood is affected more strongly by reductions in social rewards (e.g., likes).

Before my PhD, I worked as a data analyst in a social media agency, specializing in statistical modeling and machine learning. I also hold MSc degrees in Child Development (major: Developmental Psychopathology, University of Amsterdam) and in Educational Sciences (University of Porto).

I am committed to open science: my [publications](), data, and code are openly available on OSF and GitHub.

Beyond my academic work, I often collaborate with community members and professionals across fields to develop and organize community-based science and art events that integrate research, science, and art. I have co-developed projects such as [<em>Life from a Different Perspective</em>, Hear All Voices, Treehouse NDSM](), [<em>Breaking Boundaries</em>, Op de Vlucht, NDSM FUSE](), with a focus on community-building, awareness, and public engagement.
